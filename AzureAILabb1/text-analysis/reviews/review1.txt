This is the first console I've had since the 90s and it is awesome I'm 42 haven't gamed in years and bought this along with zelda breath of the wild and precious couldn't be happier. The console was easy to install and set up is very good quality and the fact you can use as a hand held device is awesome. I'm disabled and in an electric wheelchair I struggle to find things to do as I'm house bound and my disabilitys affect me greatly so this has been a absolutely wonderful experience I am totally hooked and timebflys it's a nice distraction from my chronic pain and has given me something other than reading or needle work in converted and I didn't think it was possible for me to be a gamer but I am now lol ! At first I was dying all the time couldn't get a grip with controls but after a few months I'm progressing well don't die anymore. I also purchased as pro controller from nintendo and that's awesome too and totally worth the money as I tried the cheap pro controller s and just wasted more money than just buying the Nintendo pro controller in the first place and Amazon have it 6 pounds cheaper than elsewhere I found my game play improved with the pro controller. This is a fantastic console even my friend that has a PlayStation got one as he loved the game play the simple way you can just take it out the cradle and you have hand held game to take away with you. I find it such a versatile console that suits my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and easy to set the nintendo switch account to I'm not the most tech savvy person but I managed all of this myself very intuitive controls also can not say the fact you use the cons as individual controlles for two player games and use the screen as your TV is great .
